# Tribute Page

> I created this tribute page for my cats - Bobcio and Flaczek. I was thinking about making it very serious and dedicate it to some of the greatest women who have been changing the world for other women thourghout the history but then it hit me - my cats are the ones who have been changing my life every day. They make me smile, they are always there for me and they help me when I'm feeling down. Oh, and also they are just really cute :)
